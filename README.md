Peer Review: Andrie Amor

Layout looks good, has all the features required. The search functionality works, only supports city search but works when looking for city. All the functions work as intended, looks good. Only thing I would add is the temperature measurement in the forecasts at the bottom of the page. Today's reccomendation is cool, nice work.
